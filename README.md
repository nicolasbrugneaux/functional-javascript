# Functional Javascript [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nicolasbrugneaux/functional-javascript.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/nicolasbrugneaux/functional-javascript)

Library inspired by haskell prelude and by underscore/ldoash which both have the
arguments in the wrong order so that prevents currying easily.
